<h3><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>

<p>Edmond Malone’s <i>Cursory Observations</i> was the most timely
publication in the Rowley controversy. His work appeared just as the
debate over the authenticity of the poems attributed to a
fifteenth-century priest was, after twelve years, entering its most
crucial phase.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> These curious poems had come to the attention of the
reading public in 1769, when Thomas Chatterton sent several fragments to
the <i>Town and Country Magazine</i>. The suicide of the young poet in
1770 made his story of discovering ancient manuscripts all the more
intriguing. When Thomas Tyrwhitt published the first collected edition
in March of 1777,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> speculation about whether the poems were the work of
Rowley or Chatterton began in earnest. Malone arrived in London two
months later to take up permanent residence, and very likely he soon
became in private “a&nbsp;professed anti-Rowleian.”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> But during the late 1770’s,
although anonymous writers filled the periodicals with pronouncements on
both sides of the question, there was no urgent need to demonstrate that
the poems were spurious. The essay which Tyrwhitt appended to the third
edition of Rowley poems in 1778<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id =
"tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> and Thomas Warton’s chapter in his
<i>History of English Poetry</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id =
"tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> seemed to show with sufficient authority
that the poems could not have been written in the fifteenth century. The
Rowleians, however, were diligently preparing their arguments,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> and late in 1781
they at last came forward with massive scholarly support for the Rowley
story.</p>

<p>On the first of December, Jacob Bryant published his voluminous
<i>Observations upon the Poems of Thomas Rowley: in which the
authenticity of those poems is ascertained</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> Some ten days later, Jeremiah
Milles, Dean of Exeter and President of the Society of Antiquaries,
brought out his own “edition” of the poems, with a commentary providing
extensive historical proof of what Bryant “ascertained.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> The remarks of Warton
and Tyrwhitt suddenly seemed hasty and superficial. Warton had clearly
outlined his reasons for skepticism, but he offered to show “the
greatest deference to decisions of much higher authority.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> Tyrwhitt had also
hesitated to be dogmatic. He saw fit to suggest that, since
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<a name = "pageii" id = "pageii"> </a>
Chatterton had always been equivocal, the authenticity of the poems
could be judged only on internal grounds. Merely to show what might be
gleaned from the poems themselves, he examined “<i>part</i> of the
internal evidence,” the language, and specifically “a&nbsp;<i>part</i>
only of this <i>part</i>, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘viz...words’">viz. ... <i>words</i></ins>, considered with respect to
their <i>significations</i> and <i>inflexions</i>.”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> Thus, when the apparently
exhaustive work of Bryant and Milles was published, the Rowleians could
well feel that the burden of proof now rested with the other side.
Tyrwhitt and Warton had command of the proof they needed, and eventually
they won over all but the fanatics.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id =
"tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> But for the moment any <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘ansers’">answers</ins> they could make
to Bryant and Milles would seem to be merely defensive. At this hour,
the position which they represented needed new support from someone who
could bring a fresh perspective into the debate and, if possible, throw
the confident Rowleians into confusion. Edmond Malone’s observations
served precisely these ends.</p>

<p>Malone must have set to work as soon as the books of Bryant and
Milles appeared.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a> At any rate, he rushed his essay into print. His friend
John Nichols published it, over the signature “Misopiclerus,” in the
December issue and yearly Supplement of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
which went into circulation early in January.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> To appear in these numbers,
Malone’s essay had to be in Nichols’ hands not long after the middle of
December, for copy was already going to press by then.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a> Doubtless he now put
to use many ideas which had occurred to him as the controversy
developed. But the origin of the essay was clearly his response, not
simply to the poems and the controversy surrounding them, but
specifically to what Milles and Bryant had written. His questioning of
their competence to settle literary questions is his most basic
justification of his own analysis. His refutations of their arguments
give substance to every stage of his reasoning. And even though in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> the essay is divided into two installments,
its continuity and stylistic cohesiveness indicate that Malone wrote it
purposefully at a time when his thoughts were unified by a clear
provocation.</p>

<p>A letter which Malone wrote to Lord Charlemont in Ireland on 8
January 1782 reveals something of the seriousness with which, beneath
their merriment, Malone and others regarded the Rowleian
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<a name = "pageiii" id = "pageiii"> </a>
manifesto:</p>

<p class = "inset">
The Rowley controversy, about which you enquire, is going on ding-dong.
Dr. Milles’s quarto and Mr. Bryant’s octavos are on my table, ready to
be packed in your parcel. They have said everything that could be said
on their side of the question, and have staggered some. Warton is
preparing an answer, which will be out soon; only a shilling pamphlet.
The cautious Tyrwhitt is slower in his operations. He means,
I&nbsp;<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged: quoted material">belive</ins>,
to enter deeply into the business, and it will
therefore be some time before we shall see his vindication. I&nbsp;am,
you know, a&nbsp;professed anti-Rowleian, and have just sent a little
brat into the world to seek his fortune. As I did not choose to sign my
name, I&nbsp;preferred, for the sake of a more general perusal, to give
my cursory remarks to a magazine, in consequence of which they appear
rather awkwardly, one half in that for December and the other in the
supplement, which is to be published in a few days. When I can get a
perfect copy, I&nbsp;will send it to you, for I flatter myself your
partiality to me will incline you to run your eye over it,
notwithstanding your leaning to the other side of the question. Tyrwhitt
wants me still to make a pamphlet of it, in order to bind up with all
the other pieces which that most wonderful youth, Chatterton, has given
occasion to.<a class = "tag" name = "tag15" id = "tag15" href =
"#note15">15</a></p>

<p>While his little brat was diverting the wide audience of the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, Malone was busy arranging for it to make a
more damaging sally. Tyrwhitt may have asked for a more convenient text;
what Malone gave him was a better essay. He seems to have spent the
entire month revising his work, for the pamphlet was not ready until
early in February. As late as 7 February, writers commenting on the
essay referred to and even quoted from the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =
"#note16">16</a> On 4 February, Horace Walpole, writing to thank Malone
for sending him a copy of <i>Cursory Observations</i>, said that he had
been “earnestly wishing” for such a present because Malone’s remarks
were “far too good to be committed only to the few hours of life of a
newspaper.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id = "tag17" href =
"#note17">17</a></p>

<p>The pamphlet was first advertised in the <i>St. James’s
Chronicle</i>, in which developments in the Rowley controversy were
usually announced promptly, until No. 3266 (9-12 Feb.). This and all
other advertisements of the pamphlet were for the version
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<a name = "pageiv" id = "pageiv"> </a>
of Malone’s essay which the author sent to Walpole some days earlier:
“the second edition, revised and augmented.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag18" id = "tag18" href = "#note18">18</a> This phrase on the
title-page has led scholars to miss the <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘sifnificance’">significance</ins> which Malone himself
found in the pamphlet. The phrase does not indicate, as bibliographies
have heretofore stated, that the pamphlet achieved a second printing. It
emphasizes that in the pamphlet Malone revised and expanded considerably
the essay which made its first appearance in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Every page in the pamphlet bears evidence of Malone’s revision.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> It was
necessary, of course, to re-orient the essay, which after the formula of
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> was addressed to Mr. Urban. At least one
passage, which carried a slur upon publishers, may have been changed to
suit Mr. Nichols.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20" href =
"#note20">20</a> But more indicative of his carefulness are his
revisions of words and phrases. “The whole fabrick” of Chatterton’s
poems became “the beautiful fabrick” (p.&nbsp;12). The “practice of
knitting,” which Malone wished to show had not developed as early as the
fifteenth century, he now called “the art of knitting” (p.&nbsp;24).
When he found that he had not questioned emphatically enough “the
antiquity of these MSS,” he added the phrase “not of one, but of all”
(p.&nbsp;31). Malone attended to the more general stylistic aspects of
his essay as well as to minute details. If he paused to recompute the
number of parchments which could fit into the famous Bristol chests
(p.&nbsp;59), he also changed the simple declarative “I&nbsp;shall” to
the more forceful “I&nbsp;will” throughout the essay. Although his
verbal revisions cannot be called drastic, they are numerous and are
frequently strategic.</p>

<p>Malone’s expansion of his essay, however, was in itself ample reason
to call the pamphlet a “new edition.” The reviewer for the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> might assure readers that “great part of
this pamphlet” had already appeared there,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag21" id = "tag21" href = "#note21">21</a> but there were also “great”
additions. What Malone came to consider Bryant’s “most plausible
argument” (“that every author must know his own meaning&mdash;that
Chatterton did not know the meaning of many words and lines in his book,
and therefore was not the author”), he answered in an entirely new
passage (pp.&nbsp;41-45). He observed later that “almost every writer on
the subject” subsequently “adopted” this rebuttal.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag22" id = "tag22" href = "#note22">22</a> Another crucial section
(pp.&nbsp;45-49), in which Malone
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<a name = "pagev" id = "pagev"> </a>
compares a modernized passage from “Rowley” with a passage from
Chatterton’s acknowledged poetry translated into Rowleian verse, was
also new. This critical technique, which Malone perfected, became a
standard one thereafter.<a class = "tag" name = "tag23" id = "tag23"
href = "#note23">23</a> Malone added six other passages, none of which
is less than half a page in length, as well as five footnotes
documenting or elaborating points which he had made in the magazine.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> The
most heavily augmented part of the essay is that containing
miscellaneous proofs, but Malone bolstered his initial arguments as
well. In his comparison of “Rowley’s” smooth versification with the work
of authentic late-medieval poets&mdash;the passage which, as we shall
see, Tyrwhitt thought so effective&mdash;Malone introduced two further
quotations and substituted the first lines from Bradshaw’s <i>Holy
Life</i> for those he had quoted in the magazine.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag25" id = "tag25" href = "#note25">25</a> Malone’s additions to his
essay, which taken together amount to some twenty pages (in&nbsp;a
pamphlet of sixty-two pages), represent a careful effort to support with
an irresistable battery of arguments the main line of attack which he
had thrown against the Rowleians.</p>

<p>As his second paragraph and his appeals to “poetical readers”
indicate, Malone’s fundamental message was that the Rowley poems must be
judged as literature and not as historical documents. The poems had, of
course, found many appreciative readers. A&nbsp;correspondent in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> in 1777 (XLVII, 361-365), for instance,
discussed with frank admiration the imagery, pathetic sentiment,
accommodation of sound to sense and other aspects of the poems. It was
Malone, however, who got to the heart of the matter in showing that
poetry inevitably bears the hallmark of the era in which it is written.
Even to appreciate the importance of this fact, he insisted, one must
have read the early English poets with perception and taste. In
establishing this criterion, Malone delivered his most devastating blow
against the Rowleians: all their learned arguments were irrelevant.</p>

<p>Malone’s essay helped to awaken some very witty attacks on the
Rowleians. Malone himself made use of wit in occasional passages, such
as his abuse of Milles for relying on Shakespeare’s historical accuracy
(pp.&nbsp;22-24). The cure for Rowleiomania which he prescribed in the
concluding passage aroused a good deal of comment. Not all readers were
happy that he chose to ridicule
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "pagevi" id = "pagevi"> </a>
respectable scholars,<a class = "tag" name = "tag26" id = "tag26" href =
"#note26">26</a> and the effectiveness of his humor did not go
unquestioned. Burnaby Greene, whose <i>Strictures</i> were the only
major attempt to discredit Malone, was anxious to show that, although
Malone seemed to promise humor, he did not prove to be “a&nbsp;writer
abounding in exertions of the risible muscles.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag27" id = "tag27" href = "#note27">27</a> Among the replies to Greene
were some jovial verses in the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i> very likely
contributed by Malone:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Says Bryant to Burnaby, what do you mean?</p>
<p>The Cause of old Rowley you’ve ruin’d quite clean.</p>
<p>I had taught Folk to think, by my learned <i>Farrago</i>,</p>
<p>That Drydens and Popes wrote three Centuries ago;</p>
<p>Though they stared at my Comments, and sometimes might slumber,</p>
<p>Yet the Truth they might fancy beneath all my Lumber:</p>
<p>But <i>your</i> stupid Jargon is seen through <i>instanter</i>,</p>
<p>And your Works give the Wits new Subjects for Banter.</p>
<p>Such <i>cler</i>-obscure Aid may I meet again never!</p>
<p>For now Milles and I will be laugh’d at for ever.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag28" id = "tag28" href = "#note28">28</a></p>

<p>Greene’s criticisms are frequently absurd, but probably even Malone
was ready to acknowledge that humor was not the outstanding feature of
the <i>Cursory Observations</i>. His purpose was not to satirize but to
refute.</p>

<p>Other writers in 1782, however, exerted their risible muscles much
more vigorously than Malone did. William Julius Mickle wrote <i>The
Prophecy of Queen Emma; An Ancient Ballad lately discovered, written by
Johannes Turgotus, Prior of Durham, in the Reign of William Rufus</i>,
to which he added a long satirical postscript about the discovery of the
poem. George Hardinge’s <i>Rowley and Chatterton in the Shades</i>
brilliantly depicts various scenes in the other world after news of the
Rowley controversy is carried there. The most hilarious performance of
the year&mdash;indeed, of the entire controversy&mdash;was the
<i>Archaeological Epistle to Dean Milles</i>, published by John Nichols
at the end of March,<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href =
"#note29">29</a> which turned the language of the Rowley poems
ingeniously against the two fumbling historians. Such pieces would have
appeared whether or not Malone had written the <i>Cursory
Observations</i>. The general reader was likely to find ridiculous the
sober effort to document Rowley’s existence. As a contributor to the
<i>St. James’s Chronicle</i> said, “To mistake the Apprentice of a
modern Attorney for an ancient
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<a name = "pagevii" id = "pagevii"> </a>
Priest, too nearly resembles an Incident in the new Pantomime at
Covent-Garden, where a Bailiff, intent on arresting an old Beau, is
imposed on by a Monkey dressed in his Clothes, and employed in an
awkward Imitation of his Manners.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" id =
"tag30" href = "#note30">30</a> But ridicule could hurt the Rowleians
only if their confidence had been penetrated already. Malone delivered
his strokes two months before any of the others, and the strength of his
diversified attack made it possible for the wits to strike home.</p>

<p>Throughout 1782, the <i>Cursory Observations</i> remained at the
forefront of the reaction to Milles and Bryant. In March, William Mason
wrote Walpole that he understood “a&nbsp;Mr. Malone” was “the
proto-antagonist” of the Rowleians.<a class = "tag" name = "tag31" id =
"tag31" href = "#note31">31</a> As late as the August issue of the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> appeared an “Ode, Addressed to Edmond
Malone, Esq. on his presuming to examine the learned and unanswerable
Arguments urged by Jacob Bryant, Esq. and the Rev. Dr. Milles....”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag32" id = "tag32" href = "#note32">32</a>
Perhaps the fairest contemporary appraisal of Malone’s work was given in
the June issue of the <i>Critical Review</i>. Although the reviewer felt
that some of Malone’s proofs, such as the anachronism of “knitting white
hosen,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag33" id = "tag33" href =
"#note33">33</a> were as elusive as those of the antiquaries, he found
the method of comparing “Rowley” and other poets illuminating, and the
“miscellaneous observations” he considered “frequently important, and
often decisive.” On the whole, the reviewer said, “Mr. Malone deserves
much praise for his very clear and comprehensive view” of the
controversy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag34" id = "tag34" href =
"#note34">34</a></p>

<p>In their replies to Bryant and Milles, both Warton and Tyrwhitt
referred appreciatively to the <i>Cursory Observations</i>. Warton found
that he had duplicated Malone’s method of rewriting Chatterton’s
acknowledged poetry. In a footnote, he said: “The ingenious author of
<i>Cursory Observations on the Poems of Rowley</i>, has been beforehand
with me in this sort of tryal. But mine was made, before I had seen his
very sensible and conclusive performance.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag35" id = "tag35" href = "#note35">35</a> Tyrwhitt went so far as to
let Malone speak for him: “From the <i>Language</i>, I might go on to
examine the <i>Versification</i> of these Poems; but I think it
sufficient to refer the reader, who may have any doubts upon this point,
to the specimens of really ancient poetry, with which the verses of the
pretended <i>Rowley</i> have lately been very judiciously contrasted.
Whoever reads those specimens,
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
if he has an ear, must be convinced, that the authors of them and of the
Poems did not live within the same period.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag36" id = "tag36" href = "#note36">36</a> A&nbsp;century after
Tyrwhitt, in a re-examination of the Rowley poems which is in many ways
the final word on the subject, W. W. Skeat recommended Tyrwhitt’s
<i>Vindication</i>, the chapter in Warton’s <i>History</i>, and the
<i>Cursory Observations</i> as the three contemporary analyses of the
poems which a reader should consult.<a class = "tag" name = "tag37" id =

critical powers of one of the eighteenth-century’s great scholars.</p>

E.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;W. Meyerstein’s <i>A Life of Thomas Chatterton</i>
(London, 1930). I&nbsp;wish to thank the University of Western Ontario

An advertisement in the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i>, No. 3233 (24-27
Nov.) says that the <i>Observations</i> will be published “Saturday
next.” An advertisement in No. 3235 (29&nbsp;Nov.-1 Dec.) says that the
<i>Observations</i> “this day were published.” The latter phrase was
often used in consecutive advertisements of a work during this period,
but in view of the announcement in No. 3233, it would seem that Bryant’s
work did appear on 1 Dec.</p>

Milles reprinted Tyrwhitt’s edition (except for the “Appendix,”
Tyrwhitt’s essay against the authenticity of the poems), correcting the
errata and adding a few new pieces. His commentary includes a long
answer to Tyrwhitt, a&nbsp;“Preliminary Dissertation,” introductions to
various poems, and footnotes throughout the text. Since 1782 is the year
imprinted on the title-page, bibliographies have always given this as
the year of publication. But No. 3239 of the <i>St. James’s
Chronicle</i> (8-11 Dec. 1781) advertises the work as published.
A&nbsp;MS note by Joseph Haslewood in a pamphlet at the British Museum
(shelf-mark C.39.f.16) mentions his having seen a copy of Milles’ work
which Richard Gough obtained on 12 Dec. 1781.</p>

the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i> in No. 3280 (14-16 March 1782) to be
published “in a few Days,” was <i>An Enquiry into the Authenticity of
the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley. In which the arguments of the

century, see the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, N.S., I&nbsp;(July-Dec.,
1856), 9. Neither the magazine nor the pamphlet mentioned Malone’s
authorship, but his hand in “the new Pamphlet,” at least, was soon
recognized (see the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i>, No. 3268, 14-16 Feb.
1782). One can only speculate whether Malone and Nichols were fellow
plotters from the beginning. They seem to have taken interest in each
other’s work as early as 1779, when Nichols printed for Malone special
copies of some early analogues to Shakespeare’s
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
plays. See Albert H. Smith, “John Nichols, Printer and Publisher,”
<i>The Library</i>, 5th Ser., XVIII (1963), 182-183. And evidently
Nichols had an eye out for anti-Rowleian materials. At his solicitation,
Horace Walpole allowed the <i>Letter to the Editor of the</i>
[<i>Chatterton</i>] <i>Miscellanies</i> (Strawberry Hill, 1779) to be
reprinted in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> in 1782 (LII, 189-195,

I&nbsp;have found no trace of any other version of the pamphlet, and it
is doubtful that there was time for one to be published between 8 Jan.,
when Malone wrote to Charlemont, and 31 Jan., the date of the
“Advertisement” printed in the “revised and augmented” edition. We may
presume that as editor of the magazine Nichols would not be anxious for
another printing of the essay during Jan. to compete with two numbers in
which the essay was a principal feature. All copies of the pamphlet
which I have been able to locate specify “the second edition, revised
and augmented.” In my examination of six copies (at&nbsp;the Library of
Congress, the Bodleian, and the British Museum), I&nbsp;found variation
only in the catchword on p.&nbsp;32. Although the first word on
p.&nbsp;33 is “comprise” in all copies, the catchword in three copies
(Bodleian, and British Museum shelf-marks 687.g.33 and 78.i.9) is
“contain,” the word Malone used in the magazine.* Since the copies are
otherwise identical, repeating distinctive flaws and errors (note, for
instance, “<ins class = "correction" title = "printed as shown (see reference)">written</ins>,” <a href = "#writtten">p.&nbsp;19</a>),
I&nbsp;judge that this discrepancy was seen and corrected at press, and
that all copies are of one printing.<br>

Besides the added paragraphs and footnotes, I&nbsp;have noted 235
separate textual changes. Undoubtedly some deviations in spelling and
punctuation were the printer’s work. But the number of changes in quoted
passages (see especially <a href = "#mylove">pp. 16</a> and <a href =
"#noteX">60</a>) and the regularity of changes (like those noted above)
which evidently serve a stylistic purpose suggest the author’s
meticulous revision.</p>

In reference to Bryant’s <i>Observations</i> (advertised at&nbsp;8s.),
Malone had said, “by an unwarrentable artifice of the bookseller, it is
divided into two, to furnish a pretence for demanding an uncommon
price.” Compare with this the statement on <a href =

That he had quoted out of Warton’s <i>History</i> the passages from
Hoccleve and Bradshaw, not having other texts readily at hand, indicates
Malone’s haste to publish the essay originally. He retained the Hoccleve
passage (<a href = "#aristotle">p.&nbsp;6</a>); his point about Warton’s
basis of selection is effective. But, perhaps feeling that two such
citations weakened the point, he took the trouble to bring the quotation
from Bradshaw into conformity with the other examples.</p>

The reviewer for the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> commented that Malone’s
“levity” and his <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘riducule’">ridicule</ins> of “respectable characters” could “only
reflect on himself”&mdash;LII (1782), 128. According to Joseph Haslewood
(see n.&nbsp;8), the magazine’s reviewer at this time was Richard Gough,
who devoted much of his life to antiquarian studies. For the opposite
reaction to Malone’s “cure,” see the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i>, No.
3289 (4-6 April 1782), and the <i>Critical Review</i>, LIII (1782),

Today scholars attribute the <i>Epistle</i> to William Mason, whose
letters to Walpole certainly imply that he wrote it but was zealous to
conceal the fact. See <i>Walpole’s Correspondence</i>, ed. W.&nbsp;S.
Lewis, XXIX (New Haven, 1955), 168-169, 175, 182, 189-190, 199-200; and
Philip Gaskell, <i>The First Editions of William Mason</i> (Cambridge,
1951), p.&nbsp;26. The man who published the <i>Epistle</i>, however,
says confidently, “this admirable Poem, very generally ascribed at the
time to Mr. Mason, was written by John Baynes, Esq. and handed to the
press by his intimate friend John Watson Reed, Esq.” Mason’s furtiveness
may, of course, have fooled even the publisher. The periodicals of the
day bear out at least Nichols’ word (contrary to what Gaskell says) that
the work was immediately received as Mason’s. Besides this pamphlet and
Malone’s, Nichols printed Tyrwhitt’s <i>Vindication</i> (for the
publishers T. Payne and Son). In a letter to Nichols on 18 March 1782,
George Steevens commented, “Your house seems to be the forge from which
Anti-Rowleian thunders of every kind are to be issued.” For all of the
above information, see Nichols’ <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, VIII (London,

What the warmest wishes of the admirers of the greatest Genius that
England ever produced have not yet effected, a&nbsp;magnificent and
accurate edition of his works, with notes and engravings, the product of
thy fertile brain has now obtained.&mdash;It is almost needless to say,
that I allude to two new publications by Mr. Bryant, and the Dean of
Exeter; in the <i>modest</i> title of one of which, <i>the
authenticity</i>
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
of the poems attributed to Thomas Rowley is said to be
<i>ascertained</i>; the other gentleman indeed does not go so
far&mdash;he only <i>considers and defends their antiquity</i>.&mdash;<a
name = "octavo" id = "octavo">Many persons</a>, no doubt, will be
deterred by <a class = "internal" href = "#note20">the size of these
works</a> from reading them. It is not, however, so great as they may
imagine; for Mr. Bryant’s book is in fact only a moderate octavo, though
by dextrous management it has been divided into two volumes, to furnish
an excuse (as&nbsp;it should seem) for demanding an uncommon price.
Bulky, however, as these works are, I&nbsp;have just perused them, and
entreat the indulgence of those who think the discussion of a much
controverted literary point worth attention, while I lay before them
some observations on this inexhaustible subject.</p>

<p>And, first, I beg leave to lay it down as a fixed principle, that the
authenticity or spuriousness of the poems attributed to Rowley cannot be
decided by any person who has not a <i>taste</i> for English poetry, and
a moderate, at least, if not a critical, knowledge of the compositions
of most of our poets from the time of Chaucer to that of Pope. Such a
one alone is, in my opinion, a&nbsp;competent judge of this matter; and
were a jury of twelve such persons empaneled to try the question,
I&nbsp;have not the smallest doubt what would be their almost
instantaneous decision. Without this critical knowledge and taste, all
the Saxon literature that can be
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
employed on this subject (though these learned gentlemen should pour out
waggon instead of cart-loads of&nbsp;it,) will only puzzle and perplex,
instead of illustrating, the point in dispute. Whether they are
furnished with any portion of this critical taste, I&nbsp;shall now
examine. But that I may not bewilder either my readers or myself,
I&nbsp;will confine my observation to these four points. 1.&nbsp;The
verification of the poems attributed to Rowley. 2.&nbsp;The imitations
of modern authours that are found in them. 3.&nbsp;The anachronisms with
which they abound. 4.&nbsp;The hand-writing of the Mss.&mdash;the
parchments,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "space">
I. It is very obvious, that the first and principal objection to the
antiquity of these poems is the smoothness of the versification.
A&nbsp;series of more than three thousand lines, however disfigured by
old spelling, flowing for the most part as smoothly as any of
Pope’s&mdash;is a difficult matter to be got over. Accordingly the
learned Mythologist, Mr. Bryant, has laboured hard to prove, either,
that other poets of the fifteenth century have written as smoothly, or,
if you will not allow him this, that Rowley was a prodigy, and wrote
better than all his contemporaries; and that this is not at all
incredible, it happening very frequently. And how, think you, gentle
reader, he proves his first point? He produces some verses from Spenser,
written about the year 1571; some from Sir John Cheke, written in 1553;
and others from Sir H. Lea,
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
master of the Armoury to queen Elizabeth. These having not the smallest
relation to the present question, I&nbsp;shall take no notice of them.
He then cites some verses of blind Harry, (who knows not blind Harry?)
written in the time of King Edward IV.; and some from <i>the Pilgrimage
of the Soul</i>, printed by Caxton in 1483. I&nbsp;will not encumber my
page by transcribing them; and will only observe, that they do not at
all prove the point for which they are adduced, being by no means
harmonious. But were these few verses ever so smooth, they would not
serve to decide the matter in controversy. The question is not, whether
in Chaucer, or any other ancient English poet, we can find a
<i>dozen</i> lines as smooth as</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Wincing she was, as is a jolly colt,</p>
<p>“Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt&mdash;<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">”&nbsp;</ins></p>
</div>

<p>but whether we can find <i>three thousand</i> lines as smooth as
these; containing the same rythm, the very collocation and combination
of words used in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Let us bring this matter to a very fair test. Any quotation from
particular parts of old poetry is liable to suspicion, and may be
thought to be selected by the advocates on one side as remarkably
harmonious, or by those on the other as uncommonly rugged and uncouth.
I&nbsp;will therefore transcribe the first four lines of as many ancient
poems as are now lying before me; and I request that they may be
compared
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
with the opening of <i>the Battle of Hastings</i>, N<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;1,
the piece which happens to stand first in the new quarto edition of
Chatterton’s works.</p>

<p>Divested of its old spelling, which is only calculated to mislead the
reader, and to assist the intended imposition, it begins thus:</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p>Or, as Chatterton himself acknowledged this to be a forgery, perhaps
it will be more proper to quote the beginning of <i>the Battle of
Hastings</i>, N<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;2, which he asserted to be a genuine,
ancient composition:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“O Truth! immortal daughter of the skies,</p>

<p>The reader has now before him specimens of ancient poetry, during a
period of near two hundred years; that is, for a century before the
pretended Thomas Rowley is said to have written, and for near a century
afterwards. They are for the most part taken from the commencement of
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
the works of the several authours; so that there can be no suspicion of
their having been selected, on account of their uncouthness, to prove a
particular point. I&nbsp;know not whether I flatter myself; but by
making these short extracts, I&nbsp;imagine that I have thrown more
light upon the subject now under consideration, than if I had
transcribed twenty pages of Junius, and as many of Skinner’s
<i>Etymologicon</i>, or Doomsday-book. Poetical readers may now decide
the question for themselves; and I believe they will very speedily
determine, that the lines which have been quoted from Chatterton’s poems
were not written at any one of the eras abovementioned, and will be
clearly of opinion with Mr. Walpole, (whose unpublished pamphlet on this
subject, printed at Strawberry Hill, shows him to be as amiable as he is
lively and ingenious,) that this wonderful youth has indeed “copied
ancient language, but ancient style he has never been able to imitate:”
not for want of genius, for he was perhaps the second poetical genius
that England has produced, but because he attempted something too
arduous for human abilities to perform. My objection is not to single
words, to lines or half-lines of these compositions (for here the
advocates for their authenticity always shift their ground, and plead,
that any particular exceptionable word or passage was the interpolation
of Chatterton); but it is to their whole structure, style, and rythm.
Many of the stones which this ingenious boy employed in his building, it
must be acknowledged, are as old as
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
those at Stone-henge; but the beautiful fabrick that he has raised is
tied together by modern cement, and is covered with a stucco of no older
date than that of Mess. Wyat and Adams.</p>

<p>To be more particular: In what poet of the time of Edward IV., or for
a century afterwards, will the Dean of Exeter find what we frequently
meet with in the <i>Battle of Hastings</i>, N<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;1, and
N<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;2, at the conclusion of speeches&mdash;“<i>Thus
he</i>;”&mdash;“<i>Thus Leofwine</i>;”&mdash;“<i>He said</i>; and as,”
&amp;c? In none I am confident. This latter is a form of expression in
heroick poetry, that Pope has frequently made use of in his Homer (from
whence Chatterton undoubtedly copied&nbsp;it), and was sometimes
employed by Dryden and Cowley; but I believe it will not be easy to
trace it to Harrington or Spenser; most assuredly it cannot be traced up
to the fifteenth century.<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>In
what English poem of that age will he find similies dressed in the
modern garb with which Chatterton has clothed them throughout these
pieces?&mdash;“<i>As when</i> a flight of cranes,
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>So</i> prone,” &amp;c.&mdash;“<i>As when</i> a drove of
wolves, &amp;c. <i>So</i> fought,” &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;If the reverend
Antiquarian can find this kind of phraseology in any one poet of the
time of King Edward IV., or even for fifty years afterwards, I&nbsp;will
acknowledge the antiquity of every line contained in his quarto volume.
Most assuredly neither he nor his colleague can produce any such
instance. Even in the latter end of the <i>sixteenth</i> century,
(a&nbsp;large bound from 1460,) poetical comparisons, of the kind here
alluded to, were <i>generally</i>
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
expressed either thus&mdash;“<i>Look how</i> the crown that Ariadne
wore, &amp;c. <i>So</i>,” &amp;c. “<i>Look how</i> a comet at the first
appearing, &amp;c. <i>So</i> did the blazing of my blush,” &amp;c.
“<i>Look how</i> the world’s poor people are amazed, &amp;c. <i>So</i>,”
&amp;c.&mdash;Or thus: “<i>Even as</i> an empty eagle sharpe by fast,
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>Even so</i>,” &amp;c.&mdash;“<i>Like as</i> a taper
burning in the darke, &amp;c. <i>So</i>,” &amp;c.&mdash;Such is the
general style of the latter end of the sixteenth century; though
sometimes (but very rarely) the form that Chatterton has used was also
employed by Spenser and others. In the preceding century, if I am not
much mistaken, it was wholly unknown.</p>

<p>But I have perhaps dwelled too long on this point. Every poetical
reader will find instances of modern phraseology in almost every page of
these spurious productions. I&nbsp;will only add, before I quit the
subject of style, that it is observable, that throughout these poems we
never find <a class = "internal" name = "plural" id = "plural" href =
"#noteT">a noun in the plural number</a> joined with a verb in the
singular; an offence against grammar which every ancient poet, from the
time of Chaucer to that of Shakespeare, has frequently committed, and
from which Rowley, if such a poet had existed, would certainly not have
been exempted.</p>

<p>With respect to the stanza that Chatterton has employed in his two
poems on the <i>Battle of Hastings</i>, <ins class = "correction" title
= ". missing">Mr.</ins> Bryant and the Dean of Exeter seem to think that
they stand on sure ground, and confidently quote Gascoigne, to prove
that such a stanza was known to our old English poets. “The greatest
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
part of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (says the latter gentleman,
p.&nbsp;30), and his Legend of Good Women, are in the decasyllabick
couplet; but <i>in general</i> Lidgate’s, Occleve’s, <i>Rowley’s</i>,
Spenser’s, and a great part of Chaucer’s poetry, is written in stanzas
of <i>seven</i>, <i>eight</i>, or <i>nine</i> decasyllabick lines; <i>to
which Rowley</i> generally <i>adds a tenth, and closes it with an <ins
class = "correction" title = "missing close quote?">Alexandrine.</ins></i>
All these may be ranked under the title
of <span class = "smallcaps">Rithme Royal</span>; of which Gascoigne, in
his <span class = "smallcaps">Instructions for English verse</span>, has
given the following description: “Rithme Royal is a verse of ten
syllables, and <i>seven</i> such verses make a staffe, whereof the first
and third do answer acrosse in the terminations and rime; the second,
fourth, and fifth, do likewise answer eche other in terminations; and
the two last combine and shut up the sentence: this hath been called
Rithme Royal, and surely it is a royal kind of verse, serving best for
grave discourses.” I&nbsp;leave it to the reverend Antiquarian to
reconcile the contradictory assertions with which the passage I have now
quoted sets out; and shall only observe, that we have here a great
parade of authority, but nothing like a proof of the existence of such a
stanza as Chatterton has used, in the time of K.&nbsp;Edward IV.; and at
last the Commentator is obliged to have recourse to this flimzy kind of
reasoning: “The different number of lines contained in the stanza makes
no material alteration in the structure of this verse, the stanza always
concluding with a couplet: in that of six lines, the four first rime
alternately; in that of nine, wherein
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
Spenser has composed his Fairy Queen, the sixth line rimes to the final
couplet, and the seventh to the fifth: <i>Rowley having added another
line to the stanza, the eighth rimes with the sixth.</i>”&mdash;The
upshot of the whole is, that Rowley himself, or rather Chatterton, is at
last the only authority to show that such a stanza was employed at the
time mentioned. And it is just with this kind of circular proof that we
are amused, when any very singular fact is mentioned in Chatterton’s
verses: “This fact, say the learned Commentators, is also minutely
described by Rowley in the <span class = "smallcaps">Yellow Roll</span>,
which wonderfully confirms the authenticity of these poems;” i.e. one
forgery of Chatterton in prose, wonderfully supports and authenticates
another forgery of his in rhyme.&mdash;To prevent the Dean from giving
himself any farther trouble in searching for authorities to prove that
the stanza of the <i>Battle of Hastings</i> (consisting of two quatrains
rhyming alternately, and a couplet,) was known to our early writers,
I&nbsp;beg leave to inform him, that it was not used till near three
centuries after the time of the supposed Rowley; having been, if I
remember right, first employed by Prior, who considered it as an
improvement on that of Spenser.</p>

<p class = "space">
II. The second point that I proposed to consider is, the imitations of
Pope’s Homer, Shakspeare, Dryden, Rowe, &amp;c. with which these pieces
abound. And here the cautious conduct of Chatterton’s new commentator is
very remarkable. All the similies that poor Chatterton borrowed
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>

Hastings</i>, are exhibited boldly; but then “they were all clearly
copied from the original of the Grecian Bard,” in whom we are taught,
that Rowley was better read than any other man, during the preceding or
subsequent century: but in the tragedy of <i>Ella</i>, and other pieces,
where we in almost every page meet with lines and half-lines of
Shakspeare, Dryden, &amp;c. the reverend Antiquarian is less liberal of
his illustrations. Indeed when the fraud is so manifest as not to be
concealed, the passage is produced. Thus in <i>Ella</i> we meet</p>

But it was hardly possible, says the learned Commentator, for these

cry.” (Meow, meow, meow, my!) --> Indeed! I&nbsp;suppose five or six
different modes of expressing the latter thought will occur to every
reader.</p>

<p>Can it be believed, that every one of the lines I have now quoted,
this gentleman maintains to have been written by a poet of the fifteenth
century (for all that Chatterton ever did, according to his system, was
supplying lacunæ, if there were any in the Mss., or modernizing a few
antiquated phrases)? He argues indeed very rightly, that the
<i>whole</i> of these poems must have been written by <i>one</i> person.
“Two poets, (he&nbsp;observes, p.&nbsp;81,) so distant in their æra [as
Rowley and Chatterton], so different from each other in
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
their age and disposition, could not have united their labours [he
<i>means</i>, their labours could not unite or coalesce] in the same
poem to any effect, without such apparent difference in their style,
language, and sentiments, as would have defeated Chatterton’s intent of
imposing his works on the public, as the original and entire composition
of Rowley.”&mdash;Most readers, I&nbsp;suppose, will more readily agree
with his premises than his conclusion. Every part of these poems was
undoubtedly <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged (see Introduction)"><a class = "internal" name = "writtten" id = "writtten"
href = "#note18">writtten</a></ins> by one person; but that person was
not Rowley, but Chatterton.</p>

<p>What reason have we to doubt, that he who imitated all the English
poets with whom he was acquainted, likewise borrowed his Homerick images
from the versions of Chapman and Pope; in the latter of which he found
these allusions dressed out in all the splendid ornaments of the
eighteenth century?</p>

<p><a class = "internal" name = "hastings" id = "hastings" href =
"#note24">In the new commentary</a>, indeed, on the <i>Battle of
Hastings</i>, we are told again and again, that many of the similies
which the poet has copied from Homer, contain circumstances that are
found in the Greek, but omitted in Mr. Pope’s translation. “Here
therefore we have a certain proof that the authour of these poems could
read Homer in the original<a class = "tag" name = "tagC" id = "tagC"

<span class = "pagenum">20</span>

<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
might have had the assistance of <i>other</i> translations, besides
those of Pope; the English prose version from that of Madame Dacier, the
translations by Chapman and by Hobbes. Nor yet will it follow from his
having <i>occasionally</i> consulted <i>these</i> versions, that he was
<i>not at all indebted to Pope</i>; as this gentleman endeavours to
persuade us in p.&nbsp;82. and 106. He availed himself, without doubt,
of them all. Whenever the Commentator can show a single thought in these
imitations of the Grecian Bard, that is found in the original, and not
in <i>any</i> of those translations, I&nbsp;will readily acknowledge
that <i>the Battle of Hastings</i>, and all the other pieces contained
in his quarto volume, were written by Rowley, or Turgot, or Alfred the
Great, or Merlin, or whatever other existent or non-existent ancient he
or Mr. Bryant shall choose to ascribe them to. Most assuredly no such
instance can be pointed out.</p>

<div class = "footnote">
<p><a name = "noteC" id = "noteC" href = "#tagC">&nbsp;C*&nbsp;</a>
To show how very weak and inconclusive the arguments of Chatterton’s new
Editor are on this head, I&nbsp;shall cite but one passage, from which
the reader may form a
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
judgment of all the other illustrations with which he has decorated the
<i>Battle of Hastings</i>:</p>

</div>

<p class = "author">
<span class = "smallcaps">Pope</span>, B. viii. v. 365.</p>

<p>“The imitation here seems to be very apparent, but it is the
imitation of Homer, and not of Pope; both Homer and Rowley express the
intention of the archer, which is dropped by the translator of the Greek
poet.” Chatterton’s <i>Poems</i>, quarto, p.&nbsp;83. Edit. Milles.</p>

<p>To my apprehension, the intention of the archer is very clearly
expressed in Pope’s lines; but it is unnecessary to contest that point,
for lo! thus has old Chapman translated the same passage:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“This said, another arrow forth from his stiffe string he sent</p>
<p>“At Hector, <i>whom he long’d to wound</i>; but still amisse it

<p>“His shaft smit faire Gorgy&shy;thion.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of such reasoning is the new Commentary on Chatterton’s poems
composed.</p>
</div>

<p>I do not however rest the matter here. What are we to conclude, if in
Chatterton’s imitations of Homer, we discover some circumstances that
exist in Pope’s translation, of which but very faint traces appear in
the original Greek? Such, I&nbsp;believe, may be found. It is
observable, that in all the similies we meet with many of the very
rhymes that Pope has used. Will this Commentator contend, that the
learned Rowley not only understood Homer, at a time when his
contemporaries had scarcely heard of his name, but also foresaw in the
reign of Edward IV. those additional
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
graces with which Mr. Pope would embellish him three hundred years
afterwards?</p>

<p class = "space">
III. The Anachronisms come next under our consideration. Of these also
the modern-antique compositions which we are now examining, afford a
very plentiful supply; and not a little has been the labour of the
reverend Commentator to do away their force. The first that I have
happened to light upon is in the tragedy of <i>Ella</i>,
p.&nbsp;212:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“She said, as her white hands white hosen were knitting.</p>
<p>“What pleasure it is to be married!”</p>
</div>

<p>It is certain that the art of knitting stockings was unknown in the
time of king Edward IV., the era of the pretended Rowley. This
difficulty, therefore, was by all means to be gotten over. And whom of
all men, think you, courteous reader, this sagacious editor has chosen
as an authority to ascertain the high antiquity of this practice? No
other than our great poet Shakspeare; who was born in 1564, and died in
1616. Poor Shakspeare, who gave to all the countries in the world, and
to all preceding eras, the customs of his own age and country, he is the
authour that is chosen for this purpose! “If this Scotch art (says the
Commentator) was so far advanced in a foreign country in the beginning
of the sixteenth century, can there be a doubt of its being known in
England half a century earlier? At least the art of knitting,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
and weaving bone-lace, was <i>more ancient</i> than queen Elizabeth’s
time; for Shakspeare speaks of <i>old</i> and <i>antick</i> songs,
which</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“The spinsters and the <i>knitters</i> in the sun,</p>
<p>“And the free maids that <i>weave their thread with bone</i>,</p>
<p>“Did use to chaunt.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
<i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act II. Sc. 4.</p>

<p><a class = "internal" name = "knit" id = "knit" href = "#note24">It
might be sufficient</a> to observe, that the old songs which were
chaunted by the spinsters and knitters of Shakspeare’s days, do not very
clearly ascertain the antiquity of the <i>operation</i> on which they
were employed; for I apprehend, though the art of knitting had not been
invented till 1564, when the poet was born, the practisers of it might
yet the very next day after it was known, sing ballads that were written
a hundred years before.&mdash;In order, however, to give some colour to
the forced inference that the commentator has endeavoured to extract
from this passage, he has misquoted it; for Shakspeare does not say, as
he has been represented, that the spinsters of old time <i>did</i> use
to chaunt these songs: his words are,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“O fellow, come, the song we had last night;</p>
<p>“Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain:</p>
<p>“The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,</p>
<p>“And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,</p>
<p>“<i>Do</i> use to chaunt it.”</p>
</div>

<p>These lines, it must be acknowledged, prove that the art was
<i>as</i> old as the time of Shakspeare,
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
but not one hour <i>more</i> ancient; nor would they answer the
Commentator’s purpose, even if they had been uttered by Portia in
<i>Julius Cæsar</i>, by the Egyptian queen in <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>, or by Nestor in <ins class = "correction" title =
"italicized as shown"><i>Troilus</i> and <i>Cressida</i></ins>; for, as
I have already observed, our great poet gave to all preceding times the
customs of his own age.&mdash;If the learned editor should hereafter
have occasion to prove, that <i>Dick</i> and <i>Hob</i> were common
names at Rome, and that it was an usual practice of the populace there,
two thousand years ago, to throw up their caps in the air, when they
were merry, or wished to do honour to their leaders, I&nbsp;recommend
the play of <i>Coriolanus</i> to his notice, where he will find proofs
to this purpose, all equally satisfactory with that which he has
produced from <i>Twelfth Night</i>, to show the antiquity of the art of
knitting stockings in England.</p>

<p>Many of the poems and prose works attributed to Rowley, exhibit
<a class = "internal" name = "anachronism" id = "anachronism" href =
"#note24">anachronisms</a> similar to that now mentioned. Bristol is
called a city, though it was not one till long after the death of king
Edward IV. Cannynge is spoken of as possessing a <i>Cabinet</i> of coins
and other curiosities<a class = "tag" name = "tagD" id = "tagD" href =
"#noteD">D*</a>, a&nbsp;century
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<span class = "folionum">E</span>
at least before any Englishman ever thought of forming such a
collection. <i>Drawings</i>, in the modern and technical sense of
delineations on paper or vellum, with chalks or Indian ink, are
mentioned a hundred and fifty years before the word was ever used with
that signification. <i>Manuscripts</i> are noticed as rarities, with the
idea at present annexed to them; and eagerly sought after and purchased
by Rowley, at a time when printed books were not known, and when all the
literature of the times was to be found in manuscripts alone. All these
anachronisms <i>decisively</i> prove the spuriousness of these
compositions. Other anachronisms may be traced in the poems before us,
but they are of less weight, being more properly poetical deviations
from <i>costume</i>. However I will briefly mention them. Tilts and
tournaments are mentioned at a period when they were unknown. <i>God and
my Right</i> is
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
the word used by duke William in <i>the Battle of Hastings</i>, though
it was first used by king Richard&nbsp;I. after the victory at Grizors;
and hatchments and armorial bearings, which were first seen at the time
of the Croisades, are introduced in other places with equal
impropriety.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteD" id = "noteD" href = "#tagD">&nbsp;D*&nbsp;</a>
Chatterton in his description of Cannynge’s love of the arts, &amp;c.
seems often to have had Mr. Walpole in his eye; which was very natural,
that gentleman being probably the first person who was at once a man of
literature and rank, of whose character he had any
knowledge.&mdash;Thus,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
Mr.&nbsp;W. having a very curious collection of pictures, prints,
&amp;c. Cannynge too must be furnished with a cabinet of coins and other
rarities; and there being a private printing-press at Strawberry-Hill,
(the only one perhaps in England,) the Bristol Mayor must likewise have
one. It is in one of his letters that has not yet been printed, that
Chatterton mentions his having read an account in the Rowley Mss. of
Cannynge’s intention to set up a <i>printing-press</i> at Westbury! This
merchant died in 1474; during the greater part of his life printing was
unknown; and even at the time of his death there was but one
printing-press in this kingdom, namely, that set up by Caxton, in the
Almonry of Westminster Abbey, about the year 1471.</p>

<p>One of Chatterton’s earliest fictions was an ode or short poem of two
or three stanzas in <i>alternate rhyme</i>, on the death of that
monarch, which he sent to Mr. Walpole, informing him at the same time,
that it had been found at Bristol with many other ancient poems. This,
however, either C. or his friends thought proper afterwards to suppress.
It is not, I&nbsp;believe, generally known, that this is the era which
was originally fixed upon by this wonderful youth for his forgeries,
though afterwards, as appears from Mr. Walpole’s pamphlet already
mentioned, having been informed that no such metres as he exhibited as
ancient, were known in the age of Richard I., he thought proper to shift
the era of his productions. It is remarkable, that one line yet remains
in these poems, evidently written on the first idea:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Richard of lion’s heart to fight <i>is</i> gone.”</p>
</div>

<p>“It is very improbable, as the same gentleman observes, that Rowley,
writing in the reign of Henry VI., or Edward IV., as is now pretended,
or in that of Henry IV., as was assigned by the credulous, before they
had digested their system, should incidentally, in a poem on another
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">E2</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
subject, say, <i>now</i> is Richard &amp;c.” Chatterton, having stored
his mind with images and customs suited to the times he meant originally
for the era of his fictitious ancient, introduced them as well as he
could in subsequent compositions. One other singular circumstance, which
I learn from the same very respectable authority, I&nbsp;cannot omit
mentioning.
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteE" id = "noteE" href = "#tagE">&nbsp;E*&nbsp;</a>
This fraud having been detected, we hear no more of it; but in the room
of it has been substituted <i>A List of skyllde Payncterrs and
Carvellers</i>, which is now said to have been found along with the
other Mss. and to be in the possession of Mr. Barret, of Bristol.</span>
Among the Mss. that Chatterton pretended to have discovered in the
celebrated chest at Bristol was a painter’s bill<a class = "tag" name =
"tagE" id = "tagE" href = "#noteE">E*</a>, of which, like the rest, he
produced only a copy. Great was the triumph of his advocates. Here was
an undoubted relick of antiquity! And so indeed it was; for it was
faithfully copied from the first volume of the <i>Anecdotes of
Painting</i>, printed some years before; and had been originally
transcribed by Vertue from some old parchments in the church of St. Mary
Redcliffe at Bristol (a&nbsp;person, by the by, who was indefatigable in
the pursuit of every thing that related to our ancient poets, and who
certainly at the same time would have discovered some traces of the
pretended Rowley, if any of his poetry had been lodged in that
repository). Can there be a doubt, that he who was convicted of having
forged this paper, and
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
owned that he wrote the first <i>Battle of Hastings</i>, and the
<i>Account of the ceremonies observed at the opening of the Old
Bridge</i>, was the authour of all the rest also? Were he charged in a
court of justice with having forged various notes, and clear evidence
given of the fact, corroborated by the additional testimony of his
having on a former occasion fabricated a Will of a very ancient date,
would a jury hesitate to find him guilty, because two purblind old women
should be brought into court, and swear that the Will urged against him
had such an ancient appearance, the hand-writing and language by which
the bequests were made was so old, and the parchment so yellow, that
they could not but believe it to be a genuine deed of a preceding
century?&mdash;But I have insensibly wandered from the subject of
Anachronisms. So much, however, has been already said by others on this
point, that I will now hasten to the last matter which I meant to
consider, <i>viz.</i> the Mss. themselves, which are said to have
contained these wonderful curiosities.</p>

<p class = "space">
IV. And on this head we are told by Mr. B. that the hand-writing,
indeed, is not that of any particular age, but that it is very difficult
to know precisely the era of a Ms., especially when of great antiquity;
that our kings wrote very different hands, and many of them such, that
it is impossible to distinguish one from the other; and that the
diminutive size of the parchments
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
on which these poems were written,
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteF" id = "noteF" href = "#tagF">&nbsp;F*&nbsp;</a>
At the bottom of each sheet of old deeds (of&nbsp;which there were many
in the Bristol chest) there is usually a blank space of about four or
five inches in breadth. C.&nbsp;therefore found these slips of
discoloured parchment at hand.</span>
(of&nbsp;which, I&nbsp;think, the largest that these Commentators talk
of is eight inches and a half long, and four and a half broad<a class =
"tag" name = "tagF" id = "tagF" href = "#noteF">F*</a>,) was owing to
the great scarcity of parchment in former times, on which account the
lines often appear in continuation, without regard to the termination of
the verse.</p>

<p>Most of these assertions are mere <i>gratis dicta</i>, without any
foundation in truth. I&nbsp;am not very well acquainted with the ancient
Mss. of the fourteenth or fifteenth century: but I have now before me a
very fair Ms. of the latter end of the sixteenth century, in which the
characters are as regular and uniform as possible. If twenty Mss. were
produced to me, some of that era, and others of eras prior and
subsequent to it, I&nbsp;would undertake to point out the hand-writing
of the age of queen Elizabeth, which is that of the Ms. I&nbsp;speak of,
from all the rest; and I make no doubt that persons who are conversant
with the hand-writing of preceding centuries, could with equal precision
ascertain the age of more ancient Mss. than any that I am possessed of.
But the truth is, (as&nbsp;any one may see, who accurately examines the
<i>fac simile</i> exhibited originally by Mr. Tyrwhitt in his edition of
these poems, and now again by the
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
Dean of Exeter in the new edition of them,) that Chatterton could not,
accurately and for any continuance, copy the hand-writing of the
fifteenth century; nor do the Mss. that he produced exhibit the
hand-writing of <i>any</i> century whatever. He had a turn for drawing
and emblazoning; and he found, without doubt, some ancient deeds in his
father’s old chest. These he copied to the best of his power; but the
hand-writing usually found in deeds is very different from the current
hand-writing of the same age, and from that employed in transcribing
poems. To copy even these deeds to any great extent, would have been
dangerous, and have subjected him to detection. Hence it was, that he
never produced any parchment so large as a leaf of common
folio.&mdash;What we are told of the great scarcity of parchment
formerly, is too ridiculous to be answered. Who has not seen the various
beautiful Mss. of the works of Gower and Chaucer, in several publick and
private libraries, on parchment and on vellum, a&nbsp;small part of any
one of which would have been sufficient to contain all the poems of
Rowley, in the manner in which they are pretended to have been
written?&mdash;But any speculation on this point is but waste of time.
If such a man as Rowley had existed, who could troul off whole verses of
Shakspeare, Dryden, and Pope, in the middle of the fifteenth century, he
would have had half the parchment in the kingdom at his command; statues
would have been erected to

him as the greatest prodigy that the world had ever seen; and in a few
years afterwards, when printing came to be practised, the presses of
Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde would have groaned with his productions.</p>

<p>Much stress is laid upon Chatterton’s having been seen frequently
writing, with old crumpled parchments before him. No doubt of the fact.
How else could he have imitated old hands in <i>any</i> manner, or have
been able to form even the few pretended originals that he did produce?
But to whom did he ever show these old Mss. when he was transcribing
them? To whom did he ever say&mdash;“Such and such characters denote
such letters, and the verse that I now show you in this old parchment is
of this import?” Whom did he call upon, knowing in ancient hands, (and
such undoubtedly he might have found,) to establish, by the testimony of
his own eyes, the antiquity, not of one, but of all these Mss? If an
ingenuous youth (as&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;W. justly observes), “enamoured of
poetry, had really found a large quantity of old poems, what would he
have done? Produced them cautiously, and one by one, studied them, and
copied their style, and exhibited sometimes a genuine, and sometimes a
fictitious piece? or blazed the discovery abroad, and called in every
lover of poetry and antiquity to participation of the treasure? The
characters of imposture are on every part of the story; and were it
true, it would still remain one of those improbable wonders, which we
have no reason for believing.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
<p>What has been said already concerning forged compositions, cannot be
too often repeated. If these Mss. or any part of them exist, why are
they not deposited in the British Museum, or some publick library, for
the examination of the curious? Till they are produced, we have a right
to use the language that Voltaire tells us was used to the Abbé Nodot.
“Show us your Ms. of Petronius, which you say was found at Belgrade, or
consent that nobody shall believe you. It is as false that you have the
genuine satire of Petronius in your hands, as it is false that that
ancient satire was the work of a consul, and a picture of Nero’s
conduct. Desist from attempting to deceive the learned; you can only
deceive the vulgar.”</p>

<p>Beside the marks of forgery already pointed out, these poems bear yet
another badge of fraud, which has not, I&nbsp;believe, been noticed by
any critick. Chatterton’s verses have been shown to be too smooth and
harmonious to be genuine compositions of antiquity: they are liable at
the same time to the very opposite objection; they are too old for the
era to which they are ascribed. This sounds like a paradox; yet it will
be found to be true. The versification is too modern; the language often
too ancient. It is not the language of any particular period of
antiquity, but of <i>two entire</i> centuries.&mdash;This is easily
accounted for. Chatterton had no other means of writing old language,
but by applying to glossaries and dictionaries, and these
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<span class = "folionum">F</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
comprise all the antiquated words of preceding times; many provincial
words used perhaps by a northern poet, and entirely unknown to a
southern inhabitant; many words also, used in a singular sense by our
ancient bards, and perhaps by them only once. Chatterton drawing his
stores from such a copious source, his verses must necessarily contain
words of various and widely-distant periods. It is highly probable, for
this reason, that many of his lines would not have been understood by
one who lived in the fifteenth century.&mdash;That the diction of these
poems is often too obsolete for the era to which they are allotted<a
class = "tag" name = "tagG" id = "tagG" href = "#noteG">G*</a>, appears
clearly from hence; many of them are much more difficult to a reader of
this day, without a glossary, than any one of the metrical compositions
of the age of Edward IV. Let any person, who is not very
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
profoundly skilled in the language of our elder poets, read a few pages
of any of the poems of the age of that king, from whence I have already
given short extracts, without any glossary or assistance whatsoever; he
will doubtless meet sometimes with words he does not understand, but he
will find much fewer difficulties of this kind, than while he is
perusing the poems attributed to Rowley. The language of the latter,
without a perpetual comment, would in most places be unintelligible to a
common reader. He might, indeed, from the context, <i>guess</i> at
something like the meaning; but the lines, I&nbsp;am confident, will be
found, on examination, to contain twenty times more obsolete and obscure
words than any one poem of the age of king Edward IV, now extant.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteG" id = "noteG" href = "#tagG">&nbsp;G*&nbsp;</a>
Mr. Bryant seems to have been aware of this objection, and thus
endeavours to obviate it. “Indeed in some places the language seems more
obsolete than could be expected for the time of king Edward the Fourth;
and the reason is, that some of the poems, however new modelled, were
prior to that æra. For <i>Rowley himself</i> [i.e. Chatterton] tells us
that he borrowed from Turgot; and we have reason to think that <i>he</i>
likewise copied from Chedder.” This same Chedder, he acquaints us in a
note, was “a&nbsp;poet mentioned in <i>the</i> Mss., [that is, in
Chatterton’s Mss., for I believe his name is not to be found elsewhere.]
who is supposed to have flourished about the year 1330. He is said [by
Chatterton] to have had some <i>maumeries</i> at the <i>comitating</i>
the city.” <i>Observations</i>, p.&nbsp;553. I&nbsp;wonder the learned
commentator did not likewise inform us, from the same <i>unquestionable
authority</i>, what wight <i>Maistre</i> Chedder copied.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I cannot omit to take notice of two or three
particulars on which the Dean of Exeter and Mr. Bryant much rely. The
former, in his Dissertation on <i>Ella</i>, says, “Whatever claim might
have been made in favour of Chatterton as the author [of <i>the Battle
of Hastings</i>], founded either on his own unsupported and improbable
assertion, or on the supposed possibility of his writing these two
poems, assisted by Mr. Pope’s translation [of Homer], no plea of this
kind can be urged with regard to any other poem in the collection, and
least of all to the dramatick works, or the tragedy of <i>Ella</i>;
which required not only an
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<span class = "folionum">F2</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
elevation of poetic genius far superior to that possessed by Chatterton,
but also such moral and mental qualifications as never entered into any
part of his character or conduct, and which could not possibly be
acquired by a youth of his age and inexperience.” “Where (we&nbsp;are
triumphantly asked) could he learn the nice rules of the Interlude, by
the introduction of a chorus, and the application of their songs to the
moral and virtuous object of the performance?”&mdash;Where?&mdash;from Mr. Mason’s
<ins class = "correction" title = "italicized as shown"><i>Elfrida</i>
and <i>Caractacus</i></ins>, in which he found a
perfect model of the Greek drama, and which doubtless he had read. But
<span class = "smallcaps">Ella</span> “<i>inculcates the precepts of
morality</i>;” and Chatterton, it is urged, was idle and dissolute, and
therefore could not have been the authour of it. Has then the reverend
editor never heard of instances of the purest system of morality being
powerfully enforced from the pulpit by those who in their own lives have
not been always found to adhere rigidly to the rules that they laid down
for the conduct of others? Perhaps not; but I suppose many instances of
this kind will occur to every reader. The world would be pure indeed, if
speculative and practical morality were one and the same thing. “That
knowledge of times, of men, and manners,” without which, it is said,
<i>Ella</i> could not have been written, I&nbsp;find no difficulty in
believing to have been possessed by this very extraordinary youth. Did
he
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
not, when he came to London, instead of being dazzled and confounded by
the various new objects that surrounded him, become in a short time, by
that almost intuitive faculty which accompanies genius, so well
acquainted with all the reigning topicks of discourse, with the manners
and different pursuits of various classes of men, with the state of
parties, &amp;c. as to pour out from the press a multitude of
compositions on almost every subject that could exercise the pen of the
oldest and most experienced writer<a class = "tag" name = "tagH" id =

The following notices, which Mr. Walpole has preserved, are too curious
to be omitted. They will give the reader a full idea of the professed
authorship of Chatterton. In a list of pieces written by him, but never
published, are the following:</p>

<p>5. “<span class = "smallcaps">To Lord North.</span> A Letter signed
the <span class = "smallcaps">Moderator</span>, and dated May 26, 1770,
beginning thus: “My Lord&mdash;It gives me a painful pleasure,

for rejecting the Lord Mayor Beckford’s Remonstrance.</p>

<p>6. <i>A Letter to Lord Mayor Beckford</i>, signed <span class =

abuse of Government for rejecting the Remonstrance, and begins thus:
“When the endeavours of a spirited people to free themselves from an
insupportable slavery”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. On the
back of this essay, which is directed to Chatterton’s friend, Cary, is
this indorsement:</p>

Briton</i>, 21 June, on account of the Lord Mayor’s death.</p>

Chatterton wrote also “a <i>Monks</i> Tragedy,” which, if his forgeries
had met with a more favourable reception than they did, he would
doubtless have produced as an ancient composition. With the ardour of
true genius, he wandered to the untrodden paths of the little Isle of
Man for a subject, and aspired</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p>Almost every part of the Dissertation on this tragedy is as open to
observation as that now mentioned. It is not true, as is asserted,
(p.&nbsp;175.) that the <i>rythmical tales</i>, before called
<i>tragedies</i>, first assumed a regular dramatick form in the time of
king Edward IV. These melancholy tales went under the name of tragedies
for above a century afterwards. Many of the pieces of Drayton were
called <i>tragedies</i> in the time of Queen Elizabeth, though he is not
known to have ever written a single drama. But without staying to point
out all the mistakes of the reverend critick on this subject,
I&nbsp;recommend to those readers who wish to form a decided opinion on
these poems, the same test for the tragedy of <i>Ella</i> that I have
already suggested for the <i>Battle of Hastings</i>. If they are not
furnished with any of our dramatick pieces in the original editions, let
them only cast their eyes on those ancient interludes which take up the
greater part of Mr. Hawkins’s first volume of
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
<i>The Origin of the English Drama</i> (the earliest of them composed in
1512); and I believe they will not hesitate to pronounce <i>Ella</i> a
modern composition. The dramas which are yet extant (if&nbsp;they can
deserve that name), composed between the years 1540 and 1570, are such
wretched stuff, that nothing but antiquarian curiosity can endure to
read a page of them. Yet the period I speak of is near a century after
the era of the pretended Rowley.</p>

<p>The argument of Mr. B. on this subject is too curious to be omitted:
“I&nbsp;am sensible (says he, in his <i>Observations</i>, p.&nbsp;166,)
that the plays mentioned above [the Chester Mysteries] seem to have been
confined to religious subjects.&mdash;But though the monks of the times
confined themselves to these subjects, it does not follow that people of
more learning and genius were limited in the same manner. As plays
certainly existed, the plan might sometimes be varied; and the
transition from sacred history to profane, was very natural and easy.
Many generous attempts may have been made towards the improvement of the
rude drama, and the introduction of compositions on a better model: but
the ignorance of the monks, and the depraved taste of the times, may
have prevented such writings being either countenanced or preserved. It
may be said, that we have no examples of any compositions of this sort.
But this is begging the question; <i>while we have the plays of
</i>Ælla<i> and </i>Godwin<i>
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
before us.</i>
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteK" id = "noteK" href = "#tagK">&nbsp;K*&nbsp;</a>
In the same manner argues the learned pewterer of Bristol, Mr. George
Catcott. These poems are certainly genuine, “for Rowley himself mentions
them in the <span class = "smallcaps">Yellow Roll</span>.” See his
letter in the Gentleman’s Magazine, vol. XLVIII. p.&nbsp;348.</span>
<i>The former is particularly transmitted to us as</i> Rowley’s<a class
= "tag" name = "tagK" id = "tagK" href = "#noteK">K*</a>.” I believe no
reader will be at a loss to determine, who it is that in this case
<i>begs the question</i>. Here we have another remarkable instance of
that kind of circular proof of which I have already taken notice.</p>

<p>In the multitude of topicks agitated by these commentators,
I&nbsp;had almost forgot one, much relied upon by the last-mentioned
gentleman. It is the name of <i>Widdeville</i>, which, we are informed,
(p.&nbsp;317.) is written in all the old chronicles <i>Woodville</i>;
and the question is triumphantly asked, “how could Chatterton, in his
<i>Memoirs of Cannynge</i>, [<i>Miscell.</i> p.&nbsp;119.] vary from all
these chronicles?&mdash;Where could he have found the name of
<i>Widdeville</i> except in one of those manuscripts to which we are so
much beholden?” If the learned commentator’s book should arrive at a
second edition, I&nbsp;recommend it to him to cancel this page
(as&nbsp;well as a former, in which he appears not to have known that
“<i>happy</i> man <i>be his dole</i>!” is a common expression in
Shakspeare, and for his ignorance of which he is forced to make an
awkward apology in his Appendix); and beg leave to inform him, that
Chatterton found the name of <i>Widdeville</i> in
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
a very modern, though now scarce, book,
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteL" id = "noteL" href = "#tagL">&nbsp;L*&nbsp;</a>
See the first volume of that entertaining work, p.&nbsp;67; art.
<i>Antony</i> Widwille, <i>Earl Rivers</i>.</span>
the <i>Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagL" id = "tagL" href = "#noteL">L*</a>, by Mr. Walpole,
every one of whose works most assuredly Chatterton had read.</p>

<p>The names of the combatants in <i>the Battle of Hastings</i>, an
enumeration of which takes up one third of this commentator’s work, and
which, he tells us, are only to be found in Doomsday-book and other
ancient records that Chatterton could not have seen, have been already
shown by others to be almost all mentioned in Fox’s <i>Book of
Martyrs</i>, and the <i>Chronicles</i> of Holinshed and Stowe. And what
difficulty is there in supposing that the names not mentioned in any
printed work (if&nbsp;any such there are) were found in the old deeds
that he undoubtedly examined, and which were more likely to furnish him
with a catalogue of names than any other ancient muniment whatsoever? It
is highly probable also, that in the same chest which contained these
deeds, he found some old Diary of events relating to Bristol, written by
a mayor or alderman of the fifteenth century, that furnished him with
some account of Rowley and Cannynge, and with those circumstances which
the commentators say are only <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: missing ‘be’?">to traced</ins> in William de Wircester. The
practice of keeping diaries was at that time very general, and continued
to be much in use to the middle of the last century. This, it must be
owned, is
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<span class = "folionum">G</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
a mere hypothesis, but by no means an improbable one.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss this gentleman without taking notice of a position
which he has laid down, and is indeed the basis of almost all the
arguments that he has urged to prove the authenticity of the Bristol
Mss. It is this; that as every authour must know his own meaning, and as
Chatterton has sometimes given wrong interpretations of words that are
found in the poems attributed to Rowley, he could not be the authour of
those poems.</p>

<p>If Chatterton had originally written these poems, in the form in
which they now appear, this argument might in a doubtful question have
some weight. But although I have as high an opinion of his abilities as
perhaps any person whatsoever, and do indeed believe him to have been
the greatest genius that England has produced since the days of
Shakspeare, I&nbsp;am not ready to acknowledge that he was endued with
any miraculous powers. Devoted as he was from his infancy to the study
of antiquities, he could not have been so conversant with ancient
language, or have had all the words necessary to be used so present to
his mind, as to write antiquated poetry of any considerable length, off
hand. He, without doubt, wrote his verses in plain English, and
afterwards embroidered them with such old words as would suit the sense
and metre. With these he furnished himself, sometimes probably from
memory, and sometimes from glossaries; and annexed such
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
interpretations as he found or made.
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteM" id = "noteM" href = "#tagM">&nbsp;M*&nbsp;</a>
In Chatterton’s poems many words occur, that were undoubtedly coined by
him; as <i>mole</i>, <i>dolce</i>, <i>droke</i>, <i>glytted</i>,
<i>aluste</i>, &amp;c. All these his new editor has inserted in a very
curious performance which he is pleased to call a Glossary, <i>with such
interpretations at the context supplied</i>, without even attempting to
support them either by analogy or the authority of our ancient
writers.</span>
When he could not readily find a word that would suit his metre, he
invented one<a class = "tag" name = "tagM" id = "tagM" href =
"#noteM">M*</a><ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">. </ins>If
then his old words afford some sense, and yet are sometimes interpreted
wrong, nothing more follows than that his glossaries were imperfect, or
his knowledge inaccurate; (still however he might have had a confused,
though not complete, idea of their import:) if, as the commentator
asserts, the words that he has explained not only suit the places in
which they stand, but are often more apposite than he imagined, and have
a latent and significant meaning, that never occurred to him, this will
only show, that a man’s book is sometimes wiser than himself;
a&nbsp;truth of which we have every day so many striking instances, that
it was scarcely necessary for this learned antiquarian to have exhibited
a new proof of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Let it be considered too, that the glossary and the text were not
always written at the same time; that Chatterton might not always
remember the precise sense in which he had used antiquated words; and
from a confused recollection, or from the want of the very same books
that he had consulted while he was writing his poems, might add
sometimes a false, and sometimes an
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<span class = "folionum">G2</span>
<a name = "page43" id = "page43"> </a>
imperfect, interpretation.&mdash;This is not a mere hypothesis; for in
one instance we know that the comment was written at some interval of
time after the text. “The glossary of the poem entitled <i>the Englysh
Metamorposis</i> (Mr.&nbsp;Tyrwhitt informs&nbsp;us) was written down by
C. extemporally, without the assistance of any book, at the desire and
in the presence of Mr. Barrett.”</p>

<p>I have here given this objection all the force that it can claim, and
more perhaps than it deserves; for I doubt much whether in Chatterton’s
whole volume six instances can be pointed out, where he has annexed
false interpretations to words that appear when rightly understood to
suit the context, and to convey a clear meaning: and these mistakes, if
even there are so many as have been mentioned, are very easily accounted
for from the causes now assigned.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be urged, that when I talk of the manner in which
these poems were composed, I&nbsp;am myself guilty of the fault with
which I have charged others, that of assuming the very point in
controversy; and the observation would be just, if there were not many
collateral and decisive circumstances, by which Chatterton is clearly
proved to have written them. All these concurring to show that he forged
these pieces, an investigation of the <i>manner</i> in which he forged
them, cannot by any fair reasoning be construed into an assumption of
the question in dispute.</p>

<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteN" id = "noteN" href = "#tagN">&nbsp;N*&nbsp;</a>
So that an authour cannot revise or correct his works without forfeiting
his title to them!&mdash;According to this doctrine, Garth was the
authour of only the <i>first</i> copy of <i>the Dispensary</i>, and all
the subsequent editions published in his life-time, in every one of
which there were material variations, must be attributed to some other
hand.</span>

<p>Great stress is also laid by this commentator on some variations
being found in the copies of
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
these poems that were produced by Chatterton at different times; or, to
use his own words, “there is often a material variation between the copy
and the original, which never could have happened if he had been the
author of both<a class = "tag" name = "tagN" id = "tagN" href =
"#noteN">N*</a>. He must have known his own writing, and would not have
deviated from his own purpose.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Thus in one copy of <i>the Song to Ella</i>,
which C. gave to Mr. Barrett, these lines were found:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Or seest the hatched steed,</p>
<p>“<i>Ifrayning</i> o’er the mead.”</p>
</div>

<p>Being called upon for the original, he the next day produced a
parchment, containing the same poem, in which he had written
<i>yprauncing</i>, instead of <i>ifrayning</i>; but by some artifice he
had obscured the Ms. so much, to give it an ancient appearance, that
Mr.&nbsp;B. could not make out the word without the use of
galls.&mdash;What follows from all this, but that C. found on
examination that there was no such word as <i>ifrayning</i>, and that he
substituted another in its place? In the same poem he at one time wrote
<i>locks</i>&mdash;<i>burlie</i>&mdash;<i>brasting</i>&mdash;and
<i>kennest</i>; at another,
<i>hairs</i>&mdash;<i>valiant</i>&mdash;<i>bursting</i>&mdash;and
<i>hearest</i>. Variations of this kind he could have produced without
end.&mdash;These commentators deceive themselves, and use a language
that for a moment may deceive others, by talking of one reading
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
being found in the <i>copy</i>, and another in the <i>original</i>, when
in fact all the Mss. that C. produced were equally originals. What he
called originals indeed, were probably in general more perfect than what
he called copies; because the former were always produced after the
other, and were in truth nothing more than second editions of the same
pieces<a class = "tag" name = "tagO" id = "tagO" href =
"#noteO">O*</a>.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteO" id = "noteO" href = "#tagO">&nbsp;O*&nbsp;</a>
“<i>Bie</i>,” which he wrote inadvertently in the tragedy of <span class
= "smallcaps">Ella</span>, instead of “<i>mie</i>,” (on&nbsp;which
Mr.&nbsp;B. has given us a learned dissertation)<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“<i>Bie</i> thankes I ever onne you wylle
bestowe”<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>is such a mistake as
every man in the hurry of writing is subject to. <i>By</i> had probably
occurred just before, or was to begin some subsequent line that he was
then forming in his mind. Even the slow and laborious Mr. Capel, who was
employed near forty years in preparing and printing an edition of
Shakspeare, in a Catalogue which he presented to a publick library at
Cambridge, and which he probably had revised for many months before he
gave it out of his hands, has written “<i>Bloody</i> Bloody,” as the
title of one of Fletcher’s Plays, instead of “<i>Bloody</i>
Brother.”</p>

<p>The inequality of the poems which Chatterton owned as his own
compositions, when compared with those ascribed to Rowley, has been much
insisted upon. But this matter has been greatly exaggerated. Some of the
worst lines in Chatterton’s <i>Miscellanies</i> have been selected by
Mr. Bryant to prove the point contended for; but in fact they contain
the same even and flowing versification as the others, and <i>in
general</i> display the <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘same’?">some</ins> premature abilities<a class =
"tag" name = "tagP" id = "tagP" href = "#noteP">P†</a>.&mdash;The truth
is, the
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
readers of these pieces are deceived insensibly on this subject. While
they are perusing the poems of the fictitious Rowley, they constantly
compare them with the poetry of the fifteenth century; and are ready
every moment to exclaim, how much he surpasses all his contemporaries.
While the verses that Chatterton acknowledged as his
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>

own, are passing under their eyes, they still recollect that they are
the productions of a boy of seventeen; and are slow to allow them even
that merit which they undoubtedly possess. “They are ingenious, but
puerile; flowing, but not sufficiently correct.”<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The best way of convincing the antiquarian
reader of the merit of these compositions, would be to disfigure them
with old spelling; as perhaps the most complete confutation of the
advocates for the authenticity of what are called Rowley’s poems would
be to exhibit an edition of them in modern orthography.&mdash;Let us
only apply this very simple test,&mdash;“handy-dandy let them change
places,” and I believe it would puzzle even the President of the Society
of Antiquaries himself to determine, “which is the justice, and which is
the thief;” which is the pretended ancient, and which the acknowledged
modern.</p>

The observations on this subject, of the ingenious authour of the
accurate account of Chatterton, in a book entituled
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<i>Love and Madness</i>, are too pertinent to be here omitted. “It may
be asked why Chatterton’s own Miscellanies are inferior to Rowley? Let
me ask another question: <i>Are</i> they inferior? Genius, abilities, we
may bring into the world with us; these rare ingredients may be mixed up
in our compositions by the hand of Nature. But Nature herself cannot
create a human being possessed of a complete knowledge of our world
almost the moment he is born into it. Is the knowledge of the world
which his Miscellanies contain, no proof of his astonishing quickness in
seizing every thing he chose? Is it remembered when, and at what age,
Chatterton for the first time quitted Bristol, and how few weeks he
lived afterwards? Chatterton’s Letters and Miscellanies, and every thing
which the warmest advocate for Rowley will not deny to have been
Chatterton’s, exhibit an insight into men, manners, and things, for the
want of which, in their writings, authors who have died old men, with
more opportunities to know the world, (who could have less than
Chatterton?) have been thought to make amends by other
merits.”&mdash;“In London (as&nbsp;the same writer observes) was to be
learned that which even genius cannot teach, the knowledge of life.
Extemporaneous bread was to be earned more suddenly than even Chatterton
could write poems for Rowley; and, in consequence of his employments, as
he tells his mother, publick places were to be visited, and mankind to
be frequented.”&mdash;Hence, after “he left Bristol, we see but one more
of Rowley’s poems, <i>The Ballad of Charitie</i>, and that a very short
one.”</p>

<p>Of this double transformation I subjoin a short specimen; which is
not selected on account of any extraordinary spirit in the lines that
precede, or uncommon harmony in those that follow, but chosen (agreeably
to the rule that has been observed in all the former quotations) merely
because the <i>African Eclogue</i> happens to be the <i>first</i>

<p>If however, after all, a little inferiority should be found in
Chatterton’s acknowledged productions, it may be easily accounted for.
Enjoin a young poet to write verses on any subject, and after he has
finished his exercise, show him how Shakspeare, Dryden, and Pope, have
treated the same subject. Let him then write a second copy of verses,
still on the same theme. This latter will probably be a <i>Cento</i>
from the works of the authours that he has just perused. The one will
have the merit of originality; the other a finer polish and more glowing
imagery. This is exactly Chatterton’s case. The verses that he wrote for
Rowley are <i>perhaps</i> better than his others, because they contain
the thoughts of our best poets often in their own words. The
versification is equally good in both. Let it be remembered too, that
the former were composed at his leisure in a period of near a year and a
half; the latter in about four months, and many of them to gain bread
for the day that was passing over him.</p>

<p>After his arrival in <a class = "internal" name = "london" id =
"london" href = "#note24">London</a>, if his forgeries had met with any
success, he would undoubtedly have produced ancient poetry without end;
but perceiving that the gentleman in whom he expected
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
to find at once a dupe and a patron, was too clear-sighted to be
deceived by such evident fictions, and that he could earn a livelihood
by his talents, without fabricating old Mss. in order to gain a few
shillings from Mess. Barrett and Catcott, he deserted his original plan,
and we hear little more of Rowley’s verses.</p>

<p>With regard to the time in which the poems attributed to this priest
were produced, which it is urged was much too short for Chatterton to
have been the inventor of them, it is indeed astonishing that this youth
should have been able to compose, in about eighteen months, three
thousand seven hundred verses, on various subjects; but it would have
been still more astonishing, if he had transcribed in that time the same
number of lines, written on parchment, in a very ancient hand, in the
close and indistinct manner, in which these poems are pretended to have
been written,
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteQ" id = "noteQ" href = "#tagQ">&nbsp;Q*&nbsp;</a>
Let those who may be surprised at this assertion, recollect the
wonderful inventive faculties of Chatterton, and the various
compositions, both in prose and verse, which he produced after his
arrival in London, in the short space of four months; not to mention the
numerous pieces, which he is known to have written in the same period,
and which have not yet been collected&mdash;Let them likewise examine
any one of the defaced Mss. of the fifteenth century, in the Cotton
Library, and see in what time they can transcribe a dozen lines from
it.</span>
and defaced and obliterated in many places<a class = "tag" name = "tagQ"
id = "tagQ" href = "#noteQ">Q*</a>:&mdash;unless he had been endued with
the faculty of a celebrated solicitor, who being desired a few years
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<span class = "folionum">H2</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
ago in the House of Lords to read an old deed, excused himself by saying
that it was <i>illegible</i>, informing their lordships at the same time
that he would make out a fair <i>copy</i> of it against the next day.
Chatterton, I&nbsp;believe, understood better how to make fair copies of
illegible parchments, than to read any ancient manuscript
whatsoever.</p>

<p>It is <a class = "internal" name = "amusing" id = "amusing" href =
"#note24">amusing</a> enough to observe the miserable shifts to which
his new editor is forced to have recourse, when he is obliged to run
full tilt against matters of fact.&mdash;Thus Chatterton, we find, owned
that he was the authour of the first <i>Battle of Hastings</i>; but we
are not to believe his declaration, says Mr. Thistlethwaite, whose
doctrine on this subject the reverend commentator has adopted.
“Chatterton thought himself not sufficiently rewarded by his Bristol
patrons, in proportion to what his communications deserved.” He
pretended, therefore, “on Mr. Barrett’s repeated solicitations for the
original [<i>of the Battle of Hastings</i>], that he himself wrote that
poem for a friend; thinking, <i>perhaps</i>, that if he parted with the
original poem, he might not be properly rewarded for the loss of it,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagR" id = "tagR" href = "#noteR">R*</a>”&mdash;As
if there was no other way for
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
him to avoid being deprived of a valuable ancient Ms. but by saying that
it was a forgery, and that he wrote it himself!&mdash;What, however, did
he do immediately afterwards? No doubt, he avoided getting into the same
difficulty a second time, and subjecting himself again to the
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
same importunity from his ungenerous Bristol patrons, by showing them no
more of these rarities? Nothing less. The very same day that he
acknowledged this forgery, he informed Mr. Barrett that he had another
poem, the copy of an original by Rowley; and at a <i>considerable
interval of time</i> (which indeed was requisite for writing his new
piece) he produced <i>another</i> <span class = "smallcaps">Battle of
Hastings</span>, much longer than the former; a&nbsp;fair copy from an
undoubted original.&mdash;He was again, without doubt, pressed by
Mr.&nbsp;B. to show the original Ms. of this also; and, according to Mr.
Thistlethwaite’s system, he ought again to have asserted that
<i>this</i> poem likewise was a forgery; and so afterwards of every copy
that he produced.&mdash;Can any person that considers this transaction
for a moment entertain a doubt that all these poems were his own
invention?</p>

<div class = "footnote">
<p><a name = "noteR" id = "noteR" href = "#tagR">&nbsp;R*&nbsp;</a>
Chatterton’s Poems, quarto, edit. Milles, p.&nbsp;458.</p>

<p>It was not without good reason that the editor was solicitous to
disprove Chatterton’s frank confession, respecting this poem; for he
perceived clearly that the style, the colouring, and images, are nearly
the same in this, and the second poem with the same title, and that
every reader of any discernment must see at the first glance, that he
who wrote the first <i>Battle of Hastings</i> was the authour of all
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
the other poems ascribed to Rowley.&mdash;It is observable that
Chatterton in <i>the Battle of Hastings</i>, N<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;2,
frequently imitates himself, or repeats the same images a second time.
Thus in the first poem with this title we meet</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>“he dying gryp’d the
recer’s limbe;</p>
<p>The recer then beganne to flynge and kicke,</p>

<p>Into his harte, a dedlie ghastlie wounde;</p>
<p>And downe he felle upon the crymson pleine,</p>
<p>Upon Chatillion’s soulless corse of claie.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the second <i>Battle of Hastings</i> are these lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“But as he drewe his bowe devoid of arte,</p>
<p>“So it came down upon Troyvillain’s horse;</p>
<p>“Deep thro hys hatchments wente the pointed floe;</p>
<p>“Now here, now there, with rage bleedinge he rounde doth goe.</p>
<p>“Nor does he hede his mastres known commands,</p>
<p>“Tyll, growen furiouse by his bloudie wounde,</p>
<p>“Erect upon his hynder feete he staundes,</p>
<p>“And throwes hys mastre far off to the grounde.”</p>
</div>

<p>Can any one for a moment doubt that these verses were all written by
the same person?<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The
circumstance of the wounded horse’s falling on his rider, in the
<i>first</i> of these similies, is taken directly from Dryden’s Virgil,
Æn.&nbsp;X. v.&nbsp;1283.&mdash;Chatterton’s new editor has artfully
contrasted this passage of Dryden with the <i>second</i> simile, where
that circumstance is <i>not</i> mentioned.</p>
</div>

<p>Again:&mdash;We have the positive testimony of Mr. John Ruddall,
a&nbsp;native and inhabitant of Bristol, who was well acquainted with
Chatterton, when he was a clerk to Mr. Lambert, that <i>the Account of
the ceremonies observed at the opening of the Old Bridge</i>, published
in Farley’s Journal, Oct. 1. 1768, and said to be <i>taken from an
ancient Ms.</i>, was a forgery of Chatterton’s, and acknowledged by him
to be such. Mr. Ruddall’s account of this transaction is so material,
that I will transcribe it from the Dean of Exeter’s new work, which
perhaps many of my readers may not have seen:&mdash;“During
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
that time, [while C. was clerk to Mr.&nbsp;L.] Chatterton frequently
called upon him at his master’s house, and soon after he had printed the
account of the bridge in the Bristol paper, told Mr. Ruddall, that he
was the author of it; but <i>it occurring to him afterwards</i>, that he
might be called upon to produce the original, he brought to him one day
a piece of parchment about the size of a half-sheet of fool’s-cap paper:
Mr. Ruddall does not think that any thing was written on it when
produced by Chatterton, but he saw him write several words, if not
lines, in a character which Mr. Ruddall did not understand, which he
says was totally unlike English, and as he apprehends was meant by
Chatterton to imitate or represent the original from which this account
was printed. He cannot determine precisely how much Chatterton wrote in
this manner, but says, that the time he spent in that visit did not
exceed three quarters of an hour: the size of the parchment, however,
(even supposing it to have been filled with writing) will in some
measure ascertain the quantity which it contained. He says also, that
when Chatterton had written on the parchment, he held it over the
candle, to give it the appearance of antiquity, which changed the colour
of the ink,
<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteS" id = "noteS" href = "#tagS">&nbsp;S*&nbsp;</a>
See the new edition of Chatterton’s poems, quarto, p.&nbsp;436,
437.</span>
and made the parchment appear black and a little contracted<a class =
"tag" name = "tagS" id = "tagS" href = "#noteS">S*</a>.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
<p>Such is the account of one of Chatterton’s intimate friends. And how
is this decisive proof of his abilities to imitate ancient English
handwriting, and his exercise of those abilities, evaded? Why truly, we
are told, “the <i>contraction of the parchment</i> is no discriminating
mark of antiquity; the <i>blackness</i> given by smoke appears upon
trial to be very different from the <i>yellow</i> tinge which parchment
acquires by age; and <i>the ink does not change its colour</i>, as Mr.
Ruddall seems to apprehend.” So, because these arts are not always
<i>completely successfull</i>, and would not deceive a very skilful
antiquary, we are to conclude, that Chatterton did not forge a paper
which he acknowledged to have forged, and did not in the presence of Mr.
Ruddall cover a piece of parchment with ancient characters for the
purpose of imposition, though the fact is clearly ascertained by the
testimony of that gentleman!&mdash;The reverend commentator argues on
this occasion much in the same manner, as a well-known versifier of the
present century, the facetious Ned Ward (and he too published a quarto
volume of poems). Some biographer, in an account of the lives of the
English poets, had said that “he was an ingenious writer, considering
his low birth and mode of life, he having for some time kept a publick
house in the City.” “Never was a greater or more impudent calumny
(replied the provoked rhymer); it is very well known to every
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
body, that my publick house is not in the City, but in
<i>Moorfields</i>.”&mdash;In the name of common sense, of what
consequence is it, whether in fact <i>all</i> ancient parchments are
<i>shrivelled</i>; whether smoke will give ink a <i>yellow</i>
appearance or not. It is sufficient, that Chatterton <i>thought</i> this
was the case; that he made the <i>attempt</i> in the presence of a
credible witness, to whom he <i>acknowledged</i> the purpose for which
the manœuvre was done. We are asked indeed, why he did not prepare his
pretended original before he published the copy. To this another
question is the best answer. Why is not fraud always uniform and
consistent, and armed at all points? Happily for mankind it scarcely
ever is. Perhaps (as&nbsp;Mr. Ruddall’s account seems to state the
matter) he did not think at first that he should be called upon for the
original: perhaps he was limited in a point of time, and could not
fabricate it by the day that the new bridge was opened at
Bristol.&mdash;But there is no end of such speculations. Facts are clear
and incontrovertible. Whatever might have been the cause of his delay,
it is not denied that he acknowledged this forgery to his friend Mr.
Ruddall; conjuring him at the same time not to reveal the secret
imparted to him. If this had been a mere frolick, what need of this
earnest injunction of secrecy?&mdash;His friend scrupulously kept his
word till the year 1779, when, as the Dean of Exeter informs us, “on the
prospect of procuring a
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<span class = "folionum">I</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
gratuity of ten pounds for Chatterton’s mother, from a gentleman who
sought for information concerning her son’s history, he thought so
material a benefit to the family would fully justify him for divulging a
secret, by which no person living could be a sufferer.”</p>

<p>I will not stay to take notice of the impotent attempts that
Chatterton’s new commentators have made to overturn the very
satisfactory and conclusive reasoning of Mr. Tyrwhitt’s Appendix to the
former edition of the fictitious Rowley’s Poems. That most learned and
judicious critick wants not the assistance of my feeble pen: <i>Non tali
auxilio, nec defensoribus istis<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>.</i> If he should come into the field
himself (as&nbsp;I hope he will), he will soon silence the Anglo-Saxon
batteries of his opponents.</p>

<span class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteT" id = "noteT" href = "#tagT">&nbsp;T*&nbsp;</a>
I take this opportunity of acknowledging an error into which I have
fallen in a former page (<a class = "internal" href = "#plural">13</a>),
where it is said, that no instances are found in these poems of a noun
in the plural number being joined to a verb in the singular. On a more
careful examination I observe that C. was aware of this mark of
antiquity, and that his works exhibit a <i>few</i> examples of this
disregard to grammar. He has however sprinkled them too sparingly. Had
these poems been written in the fifteenth century, Priscian’s head would
have been broken in almost every page, and I should not have searched
for these grammatical inaccuracies in vain.</span>

Dr.&nbsp;M. and Mr.&nbsp;B. together with Mr. George Catcott, pewterer,
and Mr. William Barrett, surgeon, of Bristol, and Dr. Glynn of
Cambridge, to the room over the north porch of Redcliffe church, and
that on the door of the said room <i>six</i> padlocks may be
fixed:&mdash;that in order to wean these gentlemen

them with some amusement, they may be supplied with proper instruments
to measure the length, breadth, and depth, of the empty chests now in

pieces of parchment, all eight inches and a half by four and a half,
might have been contained in those chests; [according to my calculation,
1,464,578;&mdash;but I cannot pretend to be exact:] that for the
sustenance of these gentlemen, a&nbsp;large peck loaf may be placed in a

<a href = "#note19">Introduction, Note 19.</a></span></p>

<p>This great man, we have already seen, had an idea of many of the
useful arts of life some years before they were practised. Here he
appears to have had a confused notion of that noble invention, the
printing-press. To prevent misconstruction, I&nbsp;should add, that
<i>boke</i> in the above passage means <i>manuscript</i>, no other books
being then known; In other parts of his works, <i>as represented by
Chatterton</i>, he
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
speaks of Mss. as contradistinguished from books; but in all those
places it is reasonable to suppose some interpolation by Chatterton, and
<i>those who choose it</i>, may read <i>book</i> instead of
<i>manuscript</i>; by which this trivial objection to the authenticity
of these pieces will be removed, and these otherwise discordant passages
rendered perfectly uniform and consistent.</p>

<p>This valuable relick shows with how little reason the late Mr. Tull
claimed the merit of inventing that useful instrument of husbandry, the
drill-plough.</p>

<p>I make no apology for anticipating Mr. Barret on this subject; as in
fact these short extracts will only make the publick still more desirous
to see his long-expected <i>History of Bristol</i>, which I am happy to
hear is in great forwardness, and will, I&nbsp;am told, contain a full
account of the <span class = "smallcaps">Yellow Roll</span>, and an
exact inventory of <i>Maistre William Cannynge’s</i> Cabinet of coins,
medals, and drawings, (among the latter of which are enumerated many,
highly finished, by Apelles, Raphael, Rowley, Rembrant, and Vandyck)
together with several other matters equally curious.&mdash;It is hoped
that this gentleman will gratify the publick with an accurate engraving
from a drawing by Rowley, representing the ancient Castle of Bristol,
together with the square tower ycleped the <span class =
"smallcaps">Dongeon</span>, which cannot fail to afford great
satisfaction to the purchasers of his book, as it will exhibit a species
of architecture hitherto unknown in this country; this tower (as&nbsp;we
learn from unquestionable authority, that of the Dean of Exeter
himself,) “being <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘remakably’">remarkably</ins> decorated [on paper] with images,
ornaments, tracery work, and crosses within circles, <i>in a style net
usually seen in these buildings</i>.”&mdash;Chatterton, <i>as soon as
ever he heard that Mr. Barrett was engaged in writing a History of
Bristol</i>, very obligingly searched among the Rowley papers, and a few
days afterwards furnished him with a neat <i>copy</i> of this ancient
drawing.</p>
</div>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteY" id = "noteY" href = "#tagY">&nbsp;Y‡&nbsp;</a>
This very curious and interesting history may be found in Mr. Bryant’s
<i>Observations</i>, &amp;c. p.&nbsp;512. The learned commentator seems
to have had the great father of poetry in his eye, who is equally minute
in his account of the sceptre of Achilles. See <i>Il.</i>&nbsp;Α.
v.&nbsp;234. He cannot, however, on this account be justly charged with
plagiarism; these co-incidences frequently happening. Thus Rowley in the
15th century, and Dryden in the 17th, having each occasion to say that a
man wept, use the same four identical words&mdash;“<i>Tears began to
flow.</i>”</p>
